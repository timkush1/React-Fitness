Great, let's start by enhancing the [username].js page. Here are the steps we'll take:

Create a Dashboard Component:

We'll develop a new React component called Dashboard.js that will display the user's expense overview.
This component will include visual graphs or charts. We can use chart libraries like react-chartjs-2 or recharts.
Expense Management:

We will create components for adding new expenses (AddExpense.js) and categorizing them (ExpenseCategory.js).
We'll need to ensure these components update the backend accordingly, so they'll interact with your Node.js API.
User Profile Page:

We'll create a Profile.js component where users can update their personal information.
This will involve creating form inputs that are pre-filled with current user data, and on submission, send an update request to the server.
Budget Planning Feature:

Implement a budget planner within a BudgetPlanner.js component.
Users will be able to set monthly budgets for different categories and see a visual representation of their budget vs. actual spending.
Savings Goal Tracker:

We'll develop a SavingsGoalTracker.js component where users can set financial goals and track their progress.
This will require a new model in the backend if one doesn't exist yet and corresponding frontend logic to display progress.
Let's start by creating the Dashboard component, which will be the central piece for visualizing the user's financial data.
